                This year, Wizeliners will be able to predict the Oscar winners, and win a special Wizepoints :wizepoints: prize for showing their movie savvy!

                Each person must choose their predicted winner from each of the 23 Oscar categories. You can change your selection until the deadline on Oscar Sunday March 12th 2023 at 12 pm CST. After that, the system will lock your predictions and you won't be able to modify them. Each category equals 1 point, so the maximum amount that anyone can get is 23 points.
